We are going to set up a minimal NodeJs application as possible. 
Before that please make sure you have NodeJs installed on your computer. We will follow through a few steps to accomplish this task.

### Folder structure 


Folder structure inside our app folder
```
.
├── app.js
├── node_modules


```

### Create a folder 

` mkdir app `

### Initialize npm 

` npm init --y` 

This will Initialize npm, I've skipped the CLI entries with `--y` if you want, you can fill in the details and skip the `--y` part


### Install dependencies 

`npm install express --save`

This command will install express on our local repo, if you skip `--save` this will install express as a global dependency. Which  means that you can use `express` without installing it on local repos. Please avoid global package installations, it could be dangerous.


### Dive into Code 


`app.js`
```javascript 
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

app.get('/', function( req, res ) {
  res.send("Welcome to my first application");
});

app.listen( 3000, function () {
  console.log("The application is now running on PORT 3000");
});

```

Let's go through the code one by one. 


First, we are importing a package called express, Calling the function. Whenever someone hits the route `/` we greet them with 
`Welcome to my first application`. Also, we are listening on port 3000. 

### Running the application 

`node app.js`

Now Head over to your browser (http://localhost:3000)to see the result.
