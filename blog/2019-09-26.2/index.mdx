### MongoDb installation On MACOS

I would recommend using `brew` to install MongoDB, Brew allows for easy installation, easy uninstall, start, restart and stop. 
Let's follow certain setps to make it happen.


If you already have `brew` please skip the first step.

1. Open up terminal and paste the command in your terminal.

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```


2. `/data/db` directory is required by mongodb to store the database files.


```bash 
sudo mkdir -p /data/db

```

3. We will run the command to make sure it has correct permissions to run the database.


```
sudo chown -R `id -un` /data/db

```

4. Finally run this command to run MongoDB, this will run mongoDB server/ Daemon on your local computer.

```
mondod
```

5. Run the command below to make sure you have MongoDB on your computer.


```
mongo --version
```
