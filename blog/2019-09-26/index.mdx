Express is a really nice and easy Nodejs framework that allows us to quickly build REST API's.

Please make sure you have the following. 

1. Nodejs 10 or higher.
2. MongoDB setup on your computer, Follow through this tutorial to [Setup Mongodb](https://nischalblog.netlify.com/setup-mongo-db-on-your-mac-using-homebrew "MongoDB setup") if you have'nt already.
